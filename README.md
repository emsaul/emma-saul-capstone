# Listen to Miku

## Overview

This app is just a silly little thing that lets the user flip through Hatsune Miku's Spotify discography, as well as leave behind encouraging comments for the virtual idol!

### Problem Space

Essentially this app exists purely for fun! I do not really have any problems I wish to fix with it, and my only intention is to explore implementing some of the many new things that I have learned during my time with BrainStation. Other than that maybe it can introduce users to new songs or just to Hatsune Miku in general which is always a plus!

### User Profile

Hatsune Miku fans, and really anyone that likes cute things or finding new music!

### Features

- As a user, I want to see Miku fanart
- As a user, I want to listen to new Miku music or stumble across music I already love and would enjoy hearing again
- As a user, I want to be able to leave kind messages on the comment board
- As a user, I want to be able to switch between a Halloween theme and a different theme
